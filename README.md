# stupid repo
I am studying ECE🧙‍♂️⚡and plan to do code for some stuff I learn. Some people say that you only know something when you can explain it easily. Even though I agree, I find that I will just better internalize it by actually puting it into practice, by creating actual projects based on them, and this repo should be the right place for that.

Maybe I should state that I don't have much time to invest on any project. The only free time I have is being used to learn C++🤓, since I can't write anything if don't know how to "write", so this repo will be almost empty for a very long period of time, containing only some little programs. But am I sure that, once I finish my C++ book, I will start to delve into some more complex stuff.

If you are a more experience programmer🥸, fell free to contribute, suggest any changes or point out any blunder in my code, constructive criticism is always welcome🤓👍
